    	<p align="justify"><b><font size="6">Interpretation Of K-means 
        Clustering Outputs</font></b></p>
<p align="justify">Here we will discuss how to interpret the outputs produced by experiment 
9, 
i.e., k-means clustering. So, please follow the steps as shown below to get the sample 
output for interpretation.</p>
<p align="justify">1) Select &quot;inputimage&quot; as your experimental image.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&quot;inputimage&quot; is a satellite image having 6 bands stored in BIL format as raw 
image. It has the dimension 801x1401. Since in our discussion we will cover upto 
its 4th band, so it is necessary to understand that what the first 4 bands of 
this image represents. The first four bands are as follows: blue, green, red and 
infra-red respectively.</p>
<p align="justify">2) Select &quot;No. of bands to be used&quot; as &quot;All&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Number of bands actually works as number of feature vectors. 
So here we are using all the bands for clustering. Instead of selecting &quot;All&quot; 
one can also experiment with &quot;custom&quot; and then can select particular bands to be 
used for clustering</p>
<p align="justify">3) Enter &quot;Maximum number of iteration&quot; as &quot;5&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">K-means clustering has two terminating conditions :&nbsp; 
first, if successive iterations does not produces significant difference in 
clustered output. Second, if number of iterations exceeds maximum number of 
iterations specified by user. The output will be better if you increase this 
number. One can always experiment with these values.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Note : </i>If you are using a large size image, it will be 
better to keep this number less to not overload the server.</p>
<p align="justify">4) Select &quot;Initial cluster center&quot; as &quot;Random&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">If you are clustering an image using k-means clustering then 
for first time you need to specify the starting cluster centers for each class. 
So, one can always choose &quot;Random&quot; to generate the initial clusters randomly. 
But, if you are going to perform k-means clustering on same image that you have 
used previously for clustering with same number of classes ythen you can use the 
final cluster centres produced by the program as initial cluster centers. So, it 
will be like iterating the clustering on same image further.</p>
<p align="justify">5) Enter &quot;Desired no. of classes&quot; as &quot;3&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">This will depend on your need that in how many classes you 
want to cluster the image. For testing, we are taking it as 3.</p>
<p align="justify">6) Enter any name in &quot;Name of file, storing final cluster 
centers&quot;, Here we are entering the name as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&quot;inputimage_centre_5_3&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Keeping the name in this format will help you further to 
recognize that this cluster center file is having final clusters for &quot;inputimage&quot; 
with max. no of iterations &quot;5&quot; and number of classes as &quot;3&quot;. The extension &quot;.ctr&quot; 
will be added automatically by the program.</p>
<p align="justify">7) Click on &quot;Process&quot; button</p>
<p align="justify">You will get following image as output :</p>
<p align="justify"><b><i>K-means clustered image of inputimage</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">
<img border="0" src="interpretation_images/exp9_outkmeans_final.jpg" width="646" height="369"></p>
<p align="justify">
Here one can easily notice that the original image is clustered into three 
regions with three different colors. The colors are chosen randomly by the 
program. This is the reason that why we need to perform clustering. Since, 
during clustering it uses the different bands as feature vector, the clustering 
output classify efficiently according to the objects present in the image. As 
you have already seen the FCC of this image and also interpreted that, so you 
can easily identify that the regions in this clustered image as water body 
(green), vegetation (yellow), built-up areas or other (purple).</p>
